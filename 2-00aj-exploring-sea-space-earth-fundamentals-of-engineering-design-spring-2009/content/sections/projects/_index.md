Design Challenge
----------------

Design and construct a Remotely Operated Vehicle that can be used underwater for exploration with video capabilities and sensors for measuring environmental data.

Design Constraints
------------------

*   Vehicle must be capable of submersing at least 20 ft underwater.
*   Vehicle components and instrumentation must be water-proof.
*   Vehicles can be no larger than 50cm x 50cm x 50cm (you may find that bigger may not be better…)
*   Vehicle and all components must be controlled from the top-side through a tether that is no longer than 15m, and 12V DC power.
*   Vehicle may incorporate a maximum of three (3) motors for propulsion.
*   Vehicle must incorporate one light bank, one video camera, and one sensor package.

Scientific Challenge
--------------------

Using data from the sensor package, map the "health" of the Charles River Basin, comparing data in the river with data in the Boston harbor and near the locks.

Competition Challenges
----------------------

### Competition 1: Instrumentation (10 points)

The vehicle must start behind the starting line. Then, once signaled, the vehicle will launch into the pool and navigate the ten RFID tagged buoys. After reading all ten tags, the vehicle must return to the starting line. The competition is not over! The vehicle team must use the RFID tag data recorded on the on-board memory stick to plot the topography of the ocean floor. This is not timed.

### Competition 2: Speed (max 10 points)

The vehicle must start behind the starting line. Then, once signaled, the vehicle will launch into the pool and travel to a finish line at the opposite end of the pool. The points will be awarded on a proportional scale from 0 to the time of the fastest team.

### Competition 3: Maneuverability (max 20 points)

The vehicle must start behind the starting line. Then, once signaled, the vehicle will launch into the pool and slalom the buoys in the path provided in Figure 6. The vehicle must return to the starting line, and the time will be stopped after the vehicle completely crosses the line. One point will be deducted for every buoy missed, and 10 points will be awarded on a proportional scale from 0 to the time of the fastest team and then multiplied by the percentage of buoys correctly traversed (0 to 1).

Data from the acceleration/tilt sensor must be analyzed and plotted in your final team presentation.

Final Poster Session
--------------------

Each team will create a poster that will be printed on large format in color by the teaching staff. The poster should convey your design ideas as well as any data you collect. Several sample posters are presented here, with permission of the authors.
